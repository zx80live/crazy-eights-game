        |Rules of the Crazy Eights
        |---------------------------
        |
        |In preparation, each player is dealt 8 cards from a 52-card deck. The remaining cards constitute
        |the stockpile from which players will draw when required. The top card on the stockpile is put face
        |up on the table and it becomes the discard pile. The game begins with the first player, typically to
        |the left of the dealer.
        |
        |On each playerâ€™s turn she should either discard an appropriate card onto the discard pile, or draw
        |cards one by one from the stockpile until she comes up with a suitable card to play. Playable cards
        |are determined by the top card on the discard stack, by its rank and suit; i.e. one can only discard
        |a card with the same rank or suit as the topmost card on the discard pile. If a player does not have
        |an appropriate card to play and the stockpile is empty, she passes.
        |
        |There are special cards that can be played regardless of the discard stack; including 8 of any
        |suit, which can be used regardless of the discard stack and allows the player to name a suit
        |(without rank) with which the next player should continue. The next player can then play a card of
        |that suit, or play a special card. The other special card is the Joker, which allows the next player to
        |play any card she chooses.
        |
        |The game ends when a player finishes all her cards, or the stockpile is empty and no more cards
        |are playable. The player with the fewest number of cards wins.
